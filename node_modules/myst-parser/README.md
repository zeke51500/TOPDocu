# myst-parser

MyST (Markedly Structured Text) is designed to create publication-quality documents written entirely in Markdown. The main use case driving the development and design of MyST is [JupyterBook](https://jupyterbook.org/), which helps you create educational online textbooks and tutorials with Jupyter Notebooks and narrative content written in MyST. `myst-parser` is a javascript parser for MyST markdown that brings these capabilities into a web-native environment.

## Goals

- Provide a Javascript implementation of MyST markdown
- Parse MyST into a standardized AST, based on [mdast](https://github.com/syntax-tree/mdast).
- Serialize `mdast` into a default HTML for all known roles and directives
- Expose an opinionated set of `markdown-it` plugins, to be used in ecosystems that require `markdown-it` (e.g. vscode)
- Expose extension points in MyST for new roles/directives
- Provide functionality for cross-referencing that is usually completed by Sphinx (e.g. in the [Python implementation](https://github.com/executablebooks/MyST-Parser))

## Usage

```bash
npm install myst-parser
```

In a node environment:

```javascript
import { mystParser } from 'myst-parser';
import { State, transform, mystToHast, formatHtml } from 'myst-to-html';
import rehypeStringify from 'rehype-stringify';
import { unified } from 'unified';

const pipe = unified()
  .use(mystParser)
  .use(transform, new State())
  .use(mystToHast)
  .use(formatHtml)
  .use(rehypeStringify);

const file = pipe.processSync(':::{important}\nHello to the world!\n:::');
console.log(file.value);
>> <aside class="admonition important"><p class="admonition-title">Important</p><p>Hello to the world!</p></aside>
```

In a browser:

```html
<html>
  <head>
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/myst-parser"></script>
  </head>
  <body onload="init();">
    <div id="output"></div>
    <script>
      function init() {
        const pipe = unified()
          .use(mystParser)
          .use(transform, new State())
          .use(mystToHast)
          .use(formatHtml)
          .use(rehypeStringify);
        const result = pipe.runSync('# Hello to the world!');
        const html = pipe.stringify(result);
        document.getElementById('output').innerHTML = html;
      }
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

## Developer Install

For installing the package locally, you will need [node](https://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/about-npm), both can use a global install on your system.

Once you have `npm` installed globally, navigate into this project folder and install the dependencies:

```bash
cd myst-parser
npm install
npm run start  # Start a development server to play with the library! ðŸš€
```

The scripts for building, testing, and serving the project are in the [package.json](package.json), the main ones to use are
`npm run test`, `npm run build`, and `npm run start`.

### `npm run build`

Builds the library, including compiling the typescript and bundling/minification to create `myst.min.js` which can be used in the browser directly.
This outputs to the `dist` folder, and also includes all type definitions (`*.d.ts`) in the types folder.

### `npm run test`

Run the tests, these are mostly based on the [fixtures](fixtures) folder. You can also use `npm run test:watch` to run on any file changes.

### `npm run start`

Starts a server for manually testing and playing with `myst-parser`, this uses a in-memory bundle of what would go in the `dist` folder.
Note that this does not actually build the library!
